This project explore the use of transfer learning to improve the accuracy of the popular cat and dog classification with convolution neural network

Pre-trained model : Inception resnet v2 with 54,336,736 parameters

Tools:
	Google Collaboratory: All needed dependencies have been pre-installed.

Accuracy Achieved: 97.75%

Extra: Investigation of mis-classified sample for possible intuition into why they were misclassified
